# Feed Reader Jasmine Testing

This is an RSS feed reader app with Jasmine unit testing added to test basic functions of the app. Udacity provided the app, and I wrote the Jasmine test suites following the Udacity rubric.

## Getting started

To run the app as well as see the tests, download the entire repository and open index.html in your browser. The Jasmine test results are found below the app; you may need to scroll down past the articles that appear.

## Dependencies

* Google Feed Reader API
* Handlebars
* jQuery
* Jasmine

## Authors

Sebastian Malm and Udacity

## Acknowledgments
